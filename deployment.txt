Instruction to Deploy the site

    1. You need to create project directory "laravel_blog" in the location where you want to install the app (example : var/www/html/ or htdocs depends on your operational system)
	2. You need to pull the source code from github (https://github.com/ndinopol/laravel_blog.git) and store it in "laravel_blog" directory you created 
	3. Setup httpd configuration to listen port 8383. Used port 8383 because that is the port I used in registering google sign callback. Just change httpd.conf to listen port 8383
	4. Once done pulling code from github. Locate DB file in root directory of your project. I named it "blog.sql" and import it in your localhost Database.
	5. locate env.php file in root directory of your project. And then change mysql DB configuration based on your server DB credential.
	6. For Windows, open command prompt and go to root directory of project. 
	   For Linux/Mac , open terminal  and go to root directory of project. 
	7. run <composer update>  -- this is to pull the vendors requirement to run the app.
	8. Once successfully installed the dependencies. you can access the app using port 8383 "http://localhost:8383/laravel_blog/public"
	9. Finish



    *After running the app especially the google sign page. If encountered error such as cUrl error regarding url certificate.
	*You shoud update your php.ini file. and add at the bottom of php.ini the following code below.

    [curl]
    curl.cainfo="C:\wamp64\www\laravel_blog\cacert.pem" 

    * note "C:\wamp64\www\" is the directory path of my local machine. You can change it to your directory path.
